Today I tried to do some exercises and managed to revise the concepts.

**FORMS**

To add a form to a webpage, we have to add the <form> element. All the input fields and form controls should be wrapped in an <form> element. There are lots of attributes available for the form element but the most used or important ones are action and method.

`<form action="url" method="post">`

`/* form inputs*/`

`</form>`

Text fields and Text areas in CSS Forms:-

The text areas and text fields are used to collect the text input from the users. This input information can be text, password, contact number, etc.
Text fields in CSS

The text fields are used to collect information from the user. This can be created by using the <input> element and its type attribute that describes which type of information we want to be entered by the user. We can also set the name of the input element with the help of the name attribute

`<input type="text" name="first_name">`


Radio Buttons in CSS Forms:-

Radio buttons are used when we want to give multiple choices to the user but want only one answer in response. The radio buttons are created by using the <input> element and the value of the type attribute must be radio (type="radio"). The value of the name attribute must be the same for all the radio elements within a group.

Check Boxes in CSS Forms

The checkboxes are also used to select appropriate options among multiple options. The checkboxes are similar to the radio buttons but there is a slight difference between them, that is, the checkboxes allow the user to select multiple options among all the given options but radio buttons allow the user to choose only one option among all the options. To create the checkboxes, we have to set the value of the type attribute to the checkbox.

`<input type="checkbox" name="studytonight" value="HTML" checked>`

`<input type="checkbox" name="studytonight" value="CSS">`


Drop-down lists in CSS Forms

The drop-down list is used when we want to provide a long list of choices to the user. The drop-down list is created by using the <select> and <option> element. The <select> element wraps all the menu items and each menu item is created using <option> element.

`<select name="tutorial">
  	<option>Select</option>
  	<option value="HTML" checked>HTML</option>
  	<option value="CSS">CSS</option>
  	<option value="JavaScript">JavaScript</option>
  	<option value="Bootstrap">Bootstrap</option>
</select>`

**IMAGES**

Images are an important part of any web application. Including a lot of images in a web application is generally not recommended, but it is important to use the images wherever they are required. CSS helps us to control the display of images in web applications.

The styling of an image in CSS is similar to the styling of an element by using borders and margins. There are multiple CSS properties such as border property, height property, width property, etc. that help us to style an image.

`<style>
	img {
		border-radius: 50%;
	}
	</style>`
`</head>`

`<body>`
	`<img src=
"image.jpg"
		alt="rounded-image"
		width="400"
		height="400">`
`</body>`

Using above properties, I did some exxercises.
