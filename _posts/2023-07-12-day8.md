PRACTICE HTML AND CSS

Today, I prepared a webpage and used my knowledge of HTML and CSS.

For this, firstly go to the VS code and click on "new file" Name it **PRACTICEHTML** and create a file named index.html.

The name of the document is "**BTS ARMY**".

I tried to put on a paragraph and added colors to it . I also used the span element to specify a word from the paragraph.
<!DOCTYPE html>
`<html>`                                          
`<body>`
`<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`
`</body>`
`</html>`

`<p style="color:red;">I am red</p>`
`<p style="font-size:50px;">I am big</p>`


Then I put 2 images regarding the topic and used img element.

`<img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:128px;height:128px;">`


I also created a table regarding their achievements in their whole career.

For example:

`<tr>`
    `<td>100</td>`
    `<td>200</td>`
    `<td>300</td>`
  `</tr>`


Then I included lists and wrote down their names. For example:

`<ul>`
  `<li>Coffee</li>`
  `<li>Tea</li>`
  `<li>Milk</li>`
`</ul>` 

I gave the background color to the web page.

`<body style="background-color:powderblue;">`


I have started with Part 2 Basics and covered the topic of layout with a topic called the box model.

_SEE YOU SOON_
