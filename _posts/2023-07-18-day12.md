Today, I learned various concepts regarding **IMAGES** such as:

**IMAGE TYPES AND FORMATS**

Images fall into two categories: raster and vector. Raster images are made up of pixels. Vector graphics are defined by a set of mathematical vectors (eg lines and curves). Raster images often come from cameras and scanners but they can also be produced in software. Any file with the extension of JPG, PNG, GIF is a raster image. We use these images for displaying photos. Vector images are exported from drawing tools like Adobe Illustrator. Files with the SVG extension represent vector graphics.

**CONTENT IMAGES AND BACKGROUND IMAGES**

We use the img element to display content images. Content images can represent meaningful content or be used for decorative purposes. If used for decoration, we should set the alt attribute to an empty string; otherwise, screen readers will read out the name of the file which may be distracting to the user.

`background: url(../images/bg.jpg);`
`background-repeat: no-repeat;`
``background-position: 100px 100px;``
``background-size: cover;``
``background-attachment: fixed;``

The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element. By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element.

**CSS SPRITES**

Using CSS sprites we can combine multiple images into a single image (sprite) and reduce the number of HTTP requests. The problem with CSS sprites is that every time we need to change one of the images in the sprite, we have to re-generate the sprite. So, use this technique for small images that don’t change often. You can generate a sprite using https://cssspritestool.com.

**DATA URLs**

Data URLs allow us to embed image data directly in an HTML document or a stylesheet. The embedded code is always greater than the size of the original resource and makes the document convoluted and hard to maintain.

**CLIPPING**

We can clip an image using the clip-path property in CSS. To generate a clip-path from basic templates, visit https://bennettfeely.com/clippy

`clip-path: polygon(50% 0%, ...);`

**FILTERS**

Using the filter property in CSS, we can apply filters such as grayscale, blur, saturate, brightness and so on.

 `filter: grayscale(70%);
filter: blur(3px);
filter: brightness(0.5);
filter: contrast(200%);`

**SUPPORTING HIGH-DENSITY SCREENS**

High-density screens like Apple’s Retina displays contain more pixels than standard- density screens. The pixels on these screens are smaller than the pixels on standard-density screens. So when displaying an image, the screen uses a scale factor (1.5 or greater) to scale up the image. As a result, raster images may look a bit blurry when shown on these screens. To solve this problem, we can supply 2x or 3x versions of an image using the srcset attribute of the img element.


`<img
srcset=“
images/meal.jpg 1x,
images/meal@2x.jpg 2x,
images/meal@3x.jpg 3x
”
src=“images/meal.jpg”
/>`

**RESOLUTION SWITCHING**

For flexible-sized images, we need to supply the image in various sizes for different devices like mobiles, tablets and desktop computers. If we supply a single image, the browser on each device has to resize the image which can be a costly operation. The larger the image, the more memory is needed and the more costly the resizing operation will be. Plus, the extra bytes used to download the image will be wasted. This is the resolution switching problem. To address this, we should give the img element a few image sources and the size of the image for various viewports. The browser will take the screen resolution and pixel density into account and download the image that best fits the final size. We can use https://responsivebreakpoints.com to generate our image assets for various screen sizes.

`<img
srcset=“
images/meal.jpg 400w,
images/meal@2x.jpg 800w,
images/meal@3x.jpg 1200w
“
sizes=“
(max-width: 500px) 100vw,
(max-width: 700px) 50vw,
33vw
“
src=“images/meal.jpg”
/>`

**USING MODERN IMAGE FORMATS**

WebP is a modern image format created by Google and is widely supported except in Internet Explorer. To support modern image formats, we can use the picture element with multiple sources. The picture element should always contain an img element otherwise the image is not shown.

`<picture>`
`<source type=“image/webp” srcset=“...” />`
`<source type=“image/jpeg” srcset=“...” />`
`<img src=“...” alt=“...” />`
`</picture>`

**ART DIRECTION**

Sometimes we need to show a zoomed in or a cropped version of an image for certain viewport sizes. This is the art direction problem. To handle this, we use the picture element with multiple sources. Each source should contain a media condition and a srcset. The browser will pick the first source whose media condition matches.

`<picture>`
`<source media=“(max-width: 500px)” srcset=“...” />`
`<source media=“(min-width: 501px)” srcset=“...” />`
`<img src=“...” alt=“...” />`
`</picture>`

**SCALAR VECTOR GRAPHICS**

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files are great for logos, icons, simple graphics and backgrounds with patterns. They are often very small and can scale without losing quality. You can get find plenty of beautiful SVG backgrounds on https:// svgbackgrounds.com

**FONT ICONS**

We can also use icon fonts for displaying icons. The most popular icon fonts are Font Awesome, Ionicons, and Material Design Icons.
