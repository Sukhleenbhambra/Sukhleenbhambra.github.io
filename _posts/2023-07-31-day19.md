In the last 3 days, I revised Part 1 and Part 2 (layout) topics with handwritten notes. It made my doubts and basics more
clear. Down below are the things that I found essential to use for developing a website.

. Width and height properties are only applied to block-level elements.

. By default, width, and height properties are applied to content only (BOX-SIZING)

. DIV are block-level elements whereas SPAN are inline elements and are not inserted on a new line.

. Using pixels box remains at the same size in mobiles , tabs and wider screens as RESPONSIVENESS doesn't occur with pixels.

. By default, the body element has a width of 100% and a height of 0.For better adjustment

`html{
font size:62.5%
}`

. FLEXBOX is used for laying out elements in 1 direction and it's much easier and more powerful than float.

justify-content

align content is used when height is specified.


align item 

display: flex;

We have flex-wrap also

flex-wrap: wrap; makes the boxes of the original size.

We also have flex-shrink and grow properties.

. GRID is used to layout elements in both rows and columns.

The default value is stretch for justify and align-items.

_SEE YOU SOON_
