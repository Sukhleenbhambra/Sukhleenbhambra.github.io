From last 3 days, I revised Part1 and part2 (layout) topic with handwrritten notes. It made my doubts and basics more
clear.Down below are th things that I found important to use it for developing a website.

1. Width and height properties are only applied to block-level elements.

2. By default, width and height properties are applied to content only (BOX-SIZING)

3. DIV are block level elements whereas SPAN are inline elements and are not inserted on a new line.

4. Using pixels box remains at same size in mobiles ,tabs and wider screens as RESPONSIVENESS doesnt occur with pixels.

5. By default body element has a width 100% and a height is 0.For better adjustment

`html{
font size:62.5%
}`

6. FLEXBOX is used for laying out elements in 1 direction and it's much easier and more powerful than float.

justify-content

align content is used when height is specified.


align item 

display: flex;

We have flex-wrap also


flex-wrap: wrap; makes the boxes of the original size.

We also have flex-shrink and grow properties.

7. GRID is used to layout elements in both rows and columns.

The default value is stretch for justify and align-items.

_SEE YOU SOON_
