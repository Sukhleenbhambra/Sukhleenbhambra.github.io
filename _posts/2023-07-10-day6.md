## HTML AND CSS BASICS

Today, I learned essential concepts regarding the basics of HTML and CSS. The things that I got to learn are listed below:

**ENTITIES**

Entities are used to display special characters such as angle brackets, copyright symbols, etc. The most important entities are &nbsp; (non-breaking space), &lt; (less than
sign), &gt; (greater than sign), and &copy; (copyright symbol).

**HYPERLINK**

The <a> (anchor) element, with its href attribute, is used to create a hyperlink to web pages, locations on the same page, files, and email addresses.  A relative URL specifies the target resource relative to the current resource. An absolute
URL specifies the location of a resource irrespective of the current resource. It can start with a / to indicate the root of the website or a protocol (eg http://) to represent a
resource on a different website.

**IMAGES**

The <img> element is used to display an image. It’s a common best practice to set the alt (alternative text) attribute. This helps visually impaired people understand the page content. Also, if the image cannot be loaded, the alternative text is displayed.

**VIDEOS AND AUDIOS**

The elements are used to display video and audio. These elements have boolean attributes such as controls, autoplay, and loop.

**LISTS**

The  element is used to represent a list where the order of items doesn’t matter. The  element is used to represent an ordered list of items. The  (description list) element is used to implement a glossary or to display metadata.

**TABLES**

The  element should only be used to represent tabular data. A table can have zero or more table row) elements. Each \table row  element can have zero or more cells. Cells can be data cells or header cells 

**CONTAINERS**

The elements are generic containers used for styling purposes. Divs are block-level elements, spans are inline elements. A block-level element starts on a new line and takes up the entire available horizontal space.

**SEMANTIC ELEMENTS**

Semantic elements help us write markup that is more meaningful and descriptive to search engines, screen readers, and other software. So, use div and span elements when no other semantic element is appropriate. The semantic elements in HTML5 are header, footer, nav, main,
aside, article, section, figure, time, and mark.
