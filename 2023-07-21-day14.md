Today I learned some concepts regarding **TRANSFORMATIONS**,**TRANSITION**,**ANIMATIONS**,**WRITING CLEAN AND MAINTAINABLE CSS**

**TRANSFORMATIONS**

Using the transform property, we can apply one or more transformations to an element.The most common transformation functions are rotate(), skew(), translate()
and scale().

`transform: rotate(15deg);`

`transform: rotate(-15deg);`

`transform: scale(1.3);`

`transform: skew(15deg);`

`transform: translate(10px, 20px);`

`transform: translateX(10px);`

`transform: translateY(20px);`

`transform: rotate(15deg) scale(1.3);`

**TRANSITIONS**

The transition property is used to animate one or more properties.


`transition: transform .5s;`

`transition: transform .5s ease-out;`

`transition: transform .5s ease-out 1s; /* 1s delay */`

`transition: transform .5s, color .3s;`

The transition-timing function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.

The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:

    ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is the default)
    
    linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
    
    ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
    
    ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
    
    ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
    
    cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function


**ANIMATIONS**

To create a custom animation, first, we need to define the keyframes. Each keyframe includes the list of styles to be applied at a given moment in time. Once we define the
keyframes, we can use the animation property to animate an element.

`@keyframes pop {`

`0% { transform: scale(1); }`

`50% { transform: scale(1.5); }`

`75% { transform: rotate(45deg); background: tomato; }`

`100% { transform: rotate(0); }`

`}`

`.box {`

`animation: pop 3s ease-out;`

`}`






**CSS BEST PRACTICES**

Follow a naming convention for naming IDs and classes. The most common naming conventions are PascalCase, camelCase, and kabob-case.

• For a small project, you can write all of your CSS rules in one stylesheet. Use CSS comments to create logical sections in your stylesheet. For a more complex project, you
need to separate your stylesheet into multiple files and combine them together using build tools like Webpack, Rollup, or Parcel.

• Avoid over-specific selectors. Limit nesting to two or a maximum of three selectors.

• Avoid the !important keyword as much as possible.

• Sort CSS properties. This makes it easier to read your code.

• Take advantage of style inheritance and reduce duplication in your styles.

**VARIABLES**

Use CSS variables, also called custom properties, to keep your code DRY.

The var() function is used to insert the value of a CSS variable.

`:root {495ed;`

 ` --white: #faf0e6;`
 
`}`

`body { background-color: var(--blue); }`

`h2 { border-bottom: 2px solid var(--blue); }`


**OBJECT-ORIENTED CSS**

Object-oriented CSS is a set of principles for creating reusable components. The two principles in object-oriented CSS are: 1- Separate container and content. 2- Separate
structure and skin.


 `<div class="card card--popular">`
 
      `<header class="card__header">`
      
        `<span class="card__price"></span>`
        
     ` </header>`
     
      `<div class="card__body">`

     <button class="btn"></button>
     
      </div>
      
  **BEM**

  BEM (Block Element Modifier) is a popular naming convention for CSS classes.
